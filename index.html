<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>I am a young man who likes to learn something new, I am very confident in myself.
I started to be interested in an operating system, namely Android, there I started learning about the operating system.</p>
<p>let's see what I've learned here :</p>

<h2>Magisk</h2>
<p>After I entered the world of Android, I saw something interesting, namely Magisk, a tool for rooting Android which has many tools and features that you can use.  for example : </p>
<h3>Magisk module</h3>
<p>This is a unique feature that can install or add files to partitions such as <code>/system</code>,<code>/product</code>.</p>
<p>And what's great is that it's systemless, meaning it doesn't read and write partitions, it's like doing <strong>linking</strong> on Linux.
 but this doesn't do <strong>linking</strong>, it works similar to mount union on Linux.
</p>

<h3>MagiskBoot</h3>
<p>This is a binary executable whose function is to unpack/repack images (img) and other features can patch the image.</p>

<p>Example Usage :</p>

<p><code>./magiskboot unpack boot.img</code></p>

<p><code>./magiskboot repack boot.img</code></p>

<h3>Zgisk</h3>
<p>This is a feature that is no less interesting, by activating this you can bypass Safetynet</p>

<h1>Custom Rom</h1>
<p>Custom ROMs on Android are something that I like, with the community or ROM developers here I have learned a lot about the Android system or customizing the UI of Android.
 By switching from stock ROM (factory default ROM) to custom ROM, there are many features and customizations that you can get, for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Update security patch to latest android source
	</li>
	<li>
		Free ultimate storage google photos
	</li>
	<li>Upstream to latest kernel source</li>
	<li>Debloat system apps bloatware</li>
	<li>Use Pixel launcher Port</li>
	<li>Optimize kernel for gaming performance experience</li>
	<li>Support F2FS type patition format
	<li>Support NTFS windows patition format
	<li>Use RAM Swap for added Ram extended (2GB+)
	<li>Custom Boot animation
	<li>Support Kernelsu Integration
	<li>Hight Performance for gaming (tweaks kernel)
	<li>Update to latest version android		
		
	
</ul>
<p>and there are still many features and customizations that you can use, of course I can't mention them, in essence a custom ROM is a good option for optimizing our Android device.</p>

<h1>Kernel</h1>
<p>Custom kernels on Android are one of the advantages of Android, you can install kernels from your device's community, with additional features and optimization by Android developers.  and here are some features that you can consider before installing the kernel:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Upstreams kernel to latest version</li>
	<li>Oveclocking CPU for boosting performance</li>
	<li>Support F2FS and NTFS</li>
	<li>Added Kernelsu support</li>
	<li>Update Snapdragon Driver</li>
	<li>Update GPU Driver</p>
	
</ul>
<p>I only mentioned a few of the above, of course every device/developer has features according to the hardware, in essence the custom kernel is better than the stock kernel because it is updated.</p>
<h1>Project</h1>
<p>I also developed several software on Android that is new and liked by the Android community, and below are some of my works:</p>

<h3>Jancox Tool</h3>
<p>Jancox Tool is a tool for unpacking or repacking Android ROM.</p>
<h3>Pingger Stable</h3>
<p>Pingger stable is a Magisk module to repair unstable connections.</p>
<h3>Tirexbox</h3>
<p>A feature-rich Magisk module for the Android user experience, adding several tweaks.</p>
<h3>D0lby 4tmos</h3>
<p>D0lby 4tmos is an audio equalizer ported to several devices, you can install it in Magisk.</p>
<h3>Selinux Permisiver</h3>
<p>magisk module which functions to force selinux from enforce to permasive.</p>
<h3>ROG phone boot animation</h3>
<p>Magisk module which functions to change the boot animation from stock to ASUS ROG phone</p>
<h3>LiteGapps Controller</h3>
<p>a magisk/ksu module with a complete gapps package installer and includes unique Android features</p>
<h3>LiteGapps</h3>
<p>LiteGapps is a custom google apps for android OS by optimizing several user cases. with MIT license</p>
<h3>Kopi Installer</h3>
<p>Sophisticated Android installer tool is able to convert to Magisk module, KSU module, Kopi installer.</p>
<h3>Sdm 636 Booster</h3>
<p>Snapdragon 636 booster speed cpu magisk module</p>
