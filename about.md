## Our Story

We started as a small group of freelancers who shared a common vision: to create beautiful and functional websites that deliver results. We realized that there was a gap in the market for affordable and high-quality web services. We decided to join forces and launch Example in 2020. Since then, we have grown to a full-service agency that offers a range of services, from web design and development, to branding and logo design, to SEO and social media marketing.
