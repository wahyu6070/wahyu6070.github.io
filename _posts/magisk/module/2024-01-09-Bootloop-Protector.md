When we install the Magisk or Kernelsu module, we usually experience a bootloop when the module we install is not compatible with our device, and here I will share a module that you should try to overcome the bootloop problem caused by the module we installed.

Bootloop Protector is a module developed by huskydg_bootloopsaver, which functions to overcome bootloop problems caused by the magisk module and the kernelsu module.  This module works by analyzing during the boot process whether the cellphone is bootloop or not, and if it bootsloop then this module will automatically delete all installed modules.

So this module is an effective bootloop safeguard for our Android phones, but this module also deletes all the modules you installed, even though the module you installed does not cause a bootloop.

## Features

- Can secure our cellphone from bootloop.
- Can prevent bootloop which we don't want.
- Speeds up the boot process.
- Supports all devices.
- Supports installation on magisk or ksu.
- Supports old versions of Magisk.
- The friendly module has a small size.
- Fast process when booting.



## How To Install

1. Install magisk and compenent.
2. Restart your device.
3. Open the Magisk Manager application.
4. Then install the module.
5. Reboot and done.

## Tips

- Do not install this module if you have not installed other modules.
- Don't install many versions of bootloop protector, because there are many of the same modules from different developers.  By installing simultaneously, conflicts will occur in the system.

## Conclusion

This module is very useful for those of you who have installed many Magisk or KSU modules, to provide security if a bootloop occurs caused by the module.
