When we want to create a statistical site, for example a personal blog, documentation page, portfolio, browser site or others, in general we have to write it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  but such a method will be ineffective when we create a lot of pages and write them manually using html, css and javascript, a static site generator is a solution to overcome this problem.

With a static site generator it will make it easier for us to create sites that have lots of pages, because we don't need to repeat each code again in the HTML.  Apart from that, we can write articles with markdown to make it easier for us to create articles or pages, which the site generator will convert from markdown to html.

So this time I will discuss some of the best static site generators that I have tried myself and here are some site generators that you can use on your site.

## Hugo

Hugo is a static site generator written using the <strong>Go</strong> programming language, which makes it one of the world's fastest generators.  hugo offers many themes on its official page and several features that you can use without requiring additional plugins.

With the speed offered by Hugo, this will be very useful when you have thousands of pages or more.  Hugo also has a good structure when compared to other generators, but the structure in Hugo will be difficult to understand for those who are just starting to build sites.

### Hugo's advantages

- Build quickly
- No plugin required
- Supports themes
- Neat structure


## Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator written using the <b>Ruby</b> programming language, which is the most popular generator currently.  Jekyll is very friendly for blogging and the structure in it is easy to understand, this is suitable for those who are just learning to create static sites.

Jekyll has the weakness of being slow to build, this will be felt when you have thousands of pages or more.  but jekyll has an easy to understand structure, this is suitable for those who are just starting to create static sites.

### Jekyll's advantages
- Easy to understand
- Simple
- Supports themes
- Supports plugins



## Eleventy

Eleventy is a static site generator written using the <b>Javascript</b> programming language, which is an alternative generator to Jekyll with several interesting features.  The structure of Eleventy is similar to Jekyll, even the template uses <b>liquid</b> just like Jekyll and several other addons that you can use.
