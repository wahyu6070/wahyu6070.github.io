ScorpionROM is a custom ROM based on Android 11 that offers a smooth and stable experience for Google Pixel 5 users. ScorpionROM is not affiliated with Google or any other company, and is developed by a team of volunteers who want to share their passion for Android customization.

## Features of ScorpionROM

Some of the features that ScorpionROM offers for Google Pixel 5 are:

- **Scorpion Settings**: ScorpionROM has its own settings app, where you can adjust various aspects of the system, such as status bar, navigation bar, quick settings, lock screen, notifications, gestures, and more. You can also enable or disable some of the Pixel features, such as Active Edge, Now Playing, and Ambient Display.
