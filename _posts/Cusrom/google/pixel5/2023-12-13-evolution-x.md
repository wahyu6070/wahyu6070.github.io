Evolution X is a custom ROM based on Android 11 that offers a smooth and pixel-like experience for Google Pixel 5 users. Evolution X is not affiliated with Google or any other company, and is developed by a team of volunteers who want to share their passion for Android customization.

## Features of Evolution X

Some of the features that Evolution X offers for Google Pixel 5 are:

- **Pixel UI**: Evolution X mimics the user interface of the Pixel devices, with the same launcher, icons, wallpapers, and animations. You can also customize the accent color, icon shape, and font to your liking.
- **Evolution X Settings**: Evolution X has its own settings app, where you can adjust various aspects of the system, such as status bar, navigation bar, quick settings, lock screen, notifications, gestures, and more. You can also enable or disable some of the Pixel features, such as Active Edge, Now Playing, and Ambient Display.
- **OTA Updates**: Evolution X supports OTA updates for officially supported devices, which means you can get the latest security patches and bug fixes without having to flash the ROM manually. You can also check the changelog and download the update from the Evolution X app.
- **Evolution X Music**: Evolution X has its own music player, based on Phonograph, which is a simple and elegant app that supports various audio formats, playlists, lyrics, and equalizer. You can also control the playback from the lock screen or the notification panel.
- **Evolution X Home**: Evolution X has its own launcher, based on Launcher3, which is a modified and improved version of the Pixel Launcher, with Google Now integration. You can also access the Google Feed by swiping right from the home screen, or use the Google Search widget to search the web or your device.
- **Optimized Performance and Battery Life**: Evolution X has optimized the Android Runtime (ART) and the Bionic library, which are responsible for executing and optimizing the apps and the system. This results in faster app launch, smoother performance, and better battery life.
