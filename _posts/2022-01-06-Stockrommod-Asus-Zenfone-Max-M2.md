The Zenfone Max Pro M2 is a mid-range smartphone that was released in 2018 and still has some loyal fans in 2023. However, it also has some common issues that users may encounter, such as:

- Overheating: The phone may overheat when used for intensive tasks, such as gaming, video streaming, or charging. This can affect the performance and battery life of the phone. To prevent overheating, you can avoid using the phone while charging, close the background apps, lower the brightness, and use a cooler environment.
- Screen not working properly: The phone may have some screen issues, such as touch sensitivity, ghost touches, or flickering. This can be caused by dirt, dust, oil, screen protector, or software glitches. To fix the screen issues, you can clean the screen, remove the screen protector, calibrate the touch screen, or update the software.
- Fast battery drain: The phone may have a fast battery drain issue, even though it has a huge 5000mAh battery. This can be caused by high brightness, background apps, network settings, or battery degradation. To improve the battery life, you can lower the brightness, disable the background apps, switch to a lower network mode, or replace the battery.
- Camera and audio issues: The phone may have some camera and audio issues, such as poor quality, noise, blur, or distortion. This can be caused by low-light conditions, camera settings, dirt, speaker damage, or software bugs. To improve the camera and audio quality, you can use adequate lighting, adjust the camera settings, clean the lens and speaker, or update the software.
- Software issues: The phone may have some software issues, such as lag, freeze, crash, or reboot. This can be caused by insufficient memory, corrupted files, malware, or outdated software. To fix the software issues, you can clear the cache, uninstall the unwanted apps, scan for malware, or update the software.
