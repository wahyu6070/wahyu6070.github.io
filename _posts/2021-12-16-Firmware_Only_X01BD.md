The Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 is a mid-range smartphone that was launched in 2018 with a powerful processor, a huge battery, and a near-stock Android experience. It was praised for its performance, battery life, and value for money. But how does it fare in 2023, after five years of use and updates? Is it still worth buying or keeping as a backup phone? In this article, we will review the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 in 2023 and see if it can still compete with the newer models.

## Design and Display

The Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 has a sleek and glossy design that looks premium and elegant. It has a 6.26-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1080 x 2280 pixels and a 19:9 aspect ratio. The display is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 6, which is rare for a mid-range phone. The display is bright and sharp, with good viewing angles and color reproduction. The phone has a notch at the top that houses the front camera and the earpiece. The phone also has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a micro USB port, and a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner. The phone comes in two colors: Blue and Titanium.

## Performance and Battery

The Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset, which is a decent processor for a mid-range phone. It has 3GB, 4GB, or 6GB of RAM and 32GB or 64GB of internal storage, which can be expanded up to 512GB via a dedicated microSD card slot. The phone runs on Android 9 Pie, which is a near-stock version with minimal bloatware and customizations. The phone offers a smooth and lag-free performance, with no major issues or glitches. The phone can handle multitasking, gaming, and daily tasks with ease. The phone also has a massive 5000mAh battery, which can last for more than a day on a single charge. The phone supports 10W fast charging, which can charge the phone from 0 to 50% in about an hour.

## Camera and Audio

The Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 has a dual camera setup on the back, consisting of a 12MP primary camera with an f/1.8 aperture and a 5MP depth sensor with an f/2.4 aperture. The camera can take decent photos in daylight, with good details, colors, and contrast. The camera also has a portrait mode, which can create a bokeh effect or a blurred background for your photos. The camera struggles in low-light conditions, however, as the photos tend to be noisy, grainy, and blurry. The camera also has a video mode, which can record up to 4K resolution at 30fps or 1080p resolution at 60fps. The video quality is average, with some stabilization and autofocus issues. The phone also has a 13MP front camera with an f/2.0 aperture, which can take good selfies in good lighting, but suffers from the same low-light problems as the rear camera. The phone also has a LED flash on both the front and the back.
The Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 has a single bottom-firing speaker, which is loud and clear, but lacks bass and depth. The phone also has a 3.5mm headphone jack, which can deliver good audio quality with compatible headphones. The phone also has a FM radio, which can be used with a wired headsetÂ¹.
