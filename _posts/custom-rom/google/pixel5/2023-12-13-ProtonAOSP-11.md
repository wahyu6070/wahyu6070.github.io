Protonaosp is the first custom ROM for Pixel 5 based on Android 11. It is developed by XDA Senior Member kdrag0n, who is also the creator of Proton Kernel. Protonaosp aims to provide better performance, battery life, privacy, and UI than the stock ROM.

 It also supports microG, a free and open-source alternative to Google Play ServicesÂ³. Protonaosp is available in two variants: minimal and gapps. The minimal variant is more privacy-friendly, but lacks support for some popular apps that rely on Google services. The gapps variant includes Google services and apps, such as the Google Play Store.Protonaosp can be installed using the web installer or the manual method.

## Features

Some of the features and benefits of protonaosp are:

- **Improved performance**: Protonaosp is more smooth and responsive than stock ROM, thanks to Vulkan UI rendering, reduced APEX overhead, deep system optimizations, and custom ripple animation.
- **Improved battery life**: Protonaosp has less bloatware, malware, and adware than stock ROM, which can improve battery life and reduce data usage. It also has optimized memory management and under-the-hood tweaks to save power.
- **Improved privacy**: Protonaosp supports microG, a free and open-source alternative to Google Play Services, which can increase user control and privacy. It also has privacy indicators, toggles, and dashboard for location, camera, and microphone access.
- **Improved UI**: Protonaosp has a clean and elegant UI design, with easy-to-read typography, adaptive dual-tone themes, dynamic wallpaper-based themes, seamless font weight animations, subpixel text positioning, and fewer distractions. It also has high-quality color blending and surface color generation, and modern color science for Night Light and Ambient EQ.
