- **crDroid Settings**: crDroid has its own settings app, where you can tweak various aspects of the system, such as status bar, navigation bar, quick settings, lock screen, notifications, gestures, and more. You can also enable or disable some of the Pixel features, such as Active Edge, Now Playing, and Ambient Display.
- **OTA notification**: crDroid supports OTA updates for officially supported devices, which means you can get the latest security patches and bug fixes without having to flash the ROM manually. You can also check the changelog and download the update from the crDroid app.
