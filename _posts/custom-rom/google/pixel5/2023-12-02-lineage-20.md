LineageOS is a popular custom ROM that offers a near-stock Android experience with additional features and enhancements. LineageOS 20 is based on Android 13, the latest version of the operating system that brings new features such as Material You design, privacy dashboard, one-handed mode, and more.

If you own a Google Pixel 5 (redfin), you can install LineageOS 20 on your device and enjoy the benefits of this custom ROM. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to install LineageOS 20 on Google Pixel 5 (redfin) using LineageOS recovery.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, make sure you have the following:

- A Google Pixel 5 (redfin) with an unlocked bootloader. You can unlock the bootloader by following [this guide](^4^).
- A Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with Android SDK Platform Tools installed. You can download them from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).
- A USB cable to connect your phone to your computer.
- A backup of your data, as the installation process will wipe your device.

## Download LineageOS 20 ROM for Google Pixel 5 (redfin)

The first step is to download the LineageOS 20 ROM for Google Pixel 5 (redfin) from the official website. You can find the latest build [here](^1^). The file name should be something like `lineage-20.0-20231204-nightly-redfin-signed.zip`.

## Flash Boot, Dtbo, Vendor_Kernel_Boot

The next step is to flash the boot, dtbo, and vendor_kernel_boot images from the LineageOS 20 ROM zip file. These images are required to boot the ROM and enable the device-specific features.

To flash these images, follow these steps:

- Extract the LineageOS 20 ROM zip file on your computer. You should see a folder named `lineage-20.0-20231204-nightly-redfin-signed`.
- Inside the folder, locate the files named `boot.img`, `dtbo.img`, and `vendor_kernel_boot.img`.
- Connect your phone to your computer and enable USB debugging on your phone. You can enable USB debugging by going to Settings > System > Advanced > Developer options > USB debugging.
- Open a command prompt or terminal window on your computer and navigate to the folder where you extracted the LineageOS 20 ROM zip file.
- Enter the following commands to flash the images:

```
adb reboot bootloader
fastboot flash boot boot.img
fastboot flash dtbo dtbo.img
fastboot flash vendor_kernel_boot vendor_kernel_boot.img
```

- Wait for the flashing process to finish and then reboot your phone by entering:

```
fastboot reboot
```

## Install LineageOS Recovery on Google Pixel 5 (redfin)

The next step is to install LineageOS recovery on your phone. LineageOS recovery is a custom recovery that allows you to install LineageOS 20 and other custom ROMs on your device.

To install LineageOS recovery, follow these steps:

```
fastboot reboot recovery
```

## Factory Reset

The final step before installing LineageOS 20 is to perform a factory reset on your phone. This will erase all your data and prepare your phone for the new ROM.

To perform a factory reset, follow these steps:

- In LineageOS recovery, tap on Factory reset.
- Tap on Format data / factory reset.
- Tap on Yes to confirm.
- Wait for the formatting process to finish and then go back to the main menu.
