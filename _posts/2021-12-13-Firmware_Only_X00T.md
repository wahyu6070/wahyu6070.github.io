The Zenfone Max Pro M1 is a powerful and affordable smartphone that runs on a near-stock Android ROM. It has a 5000mAh battery, a dual camera setup, and a 5.99-inch display. If you own this device, you might want to know some tips and tricks to make the most out of it. Here are some of the best tips for Zenfone Max Pro M1 users:

## 1. Use Portrait Mode for Bokeh Effect

The Zenfone Max Pro M1 has a depth-sensing second camera that can create a bokeh effect, or a blurred background, for your photos. To use this feature, you need to tap the portrait mode icon in the top strip of the camera app, next to the settings wheel. The portrait mode option in the sidebar menu is not the same as the bokeh mode. The portrait mode shots on the phone look better than what you see on the viewfinder screen before pressing the shutter key.
## 2. Change Font Size for Better Readability

If you prefer bigger fonts that are easier on your eyes, you can change the font size in the display settings. Go to Settings > Display > Advanced > Font Size and adjust the slider to your liking. You can also change the display size, which affects the size of icons and other elements on the screen.

## 3. Show Battery Percentage in the Status Bar

The Zenfone Max Pro M1 has a huge battery that can last for a long time, but it is still useful to know how much juice you have left. To show the battery percentage in the status bar, go to Settings > Battery and toggle on Battery percentage. You can also check other battery-related stats and settings in the same menu

## 4. Use Two 4G VoLTE SIM Cards Simultaneously

The Zenfone Max Pro M1 is one of the few phones that support two VoLTE SIM cards at the same time. This means you can use a Jio SIM for calling and another SIM for data without turning the Jio SIM off. To manage the two VoLTE SIM cards, go to Settings > Network & Internet. You can select the preferred network type for both SIM 1 and SIM 2, as well as the default SIM for data, calls, and texts.

## 5. Access Zenmotion Gestures for Quick Actions

The Zenfone Max Pro M1 has some Zenmotion gestures that let you perform quick actions with your phone. For example, you can double tap the screen to wake up or sleep the phone, swipe up with three fingers to take a screenshot, or draw a letter on the screen to launch an app. To access these gestures, go to Settings > System > Gestures and enable the ones you want to use.

## 6. Turn on Battery Saver Automatically

The Zenfone Max Pro M1 has a battery saver mode that reduces the performance and background activity of the phone to save power. You can turn on this mode manually by tapping the battery icon in the quick settings panel, or you can set it to turn on automatically when the battery level reaches a certain percentage. To do this, go to Settings > Battery > Battery Saver and choose the percentage you want 

## 7. Customize the Navigation Bar

The Zenfone Max Pro M1 has a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen that has three buttons: back, home, and recent apps. You can customize the appearance and function of this bar by going to Settings > System > System UI Tuner > Navigation Bar. You can change the layout, color, and icons of the buttons, as well as add extra buttons for notifications, power, and screen rotation.
