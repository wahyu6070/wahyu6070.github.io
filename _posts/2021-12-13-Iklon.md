<p>Android is developed by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released, at which point the source code is made available to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP),[166] an open source initiative led by Google.[167] The AOSP code can be found without modification on select devices, mainly the former Nexus and current Android One series of devices.[168]

The source code is, in turn, customized by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to run on their hardware.[169][170] Android's source code does not contain the device drivers, often proprietary, that are needed for certain hardware components.[171] As a result, most Android devices, including Google's own, ship with a combination of free and open source and proprietary software, with the software required for accessing Google services falling into the latter category.[citation needed]
