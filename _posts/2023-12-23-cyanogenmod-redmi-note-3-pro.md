This time I will share a custom ROM, namely CyanogenMod for Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro (Kenzo) based on Android 5.1, so this ROM is actually very old school because CyanogenMod itself has stopped operating and distributing custom ROMs in full.

Even though this ROM is old school, it can make us nostalgic, especially for those who like to use custom ROMs and modify their Android, this ROM was quite popular in its time, even this Cyanogenmod custom ROM is a very legendary ROM because this ROM provides very real changes compared to using the default ROM.  vendors.

*Why am I discussing this old school rom?*

So the story is that I wanted to test LiteApps based on Android 5.0 so I found this ROM. Coincidentally, my cellphone is a Redmi Note 3 Pro which supports this ROM and the ROM which has been available for a long time is still available on several other websites.  and I successfully tested this ROM and it ran smoothly.

After I installed this ROM on my Kenzo, I felt that this ROM was really outdated in terms of menus, appearance, features and so on, if you compare it to the current ROM, which at the time this article was written had reached Android 14, so I recommend using this ROM.  to reminisce about this Cyanogenmod ROM which is a legend in the custom ROM world.

But even though this ROM is old school, it still has features that are no less than the latest Android version now, here are some of the CyanogenMod features on Redmi Note 3 Pro:

## Features
